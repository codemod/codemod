This guide takes you from zero to a published codemod. Each step includes just enough to get started, with links to deeper documentation.

## Building codemods

Codemods can be built using:
- **[MCP](/model-context-protocol)** — AI-assisted creation in your IDE (recommended for getting started)
- **[Studio](/platform/codemod-studio)** — Web-based prototyping with live runner and AST viewer
- **[Manually](/workflows/quickstart)** — Scaffold and build locally with `npx codemod init`

This guide walks through MCP. Once you have a codemod package, validation, running, and publishing work the same way regardless of how you built it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate a codemod">
    Make sure you have [MCP installed](/model-context-protocol#quick-setup), then ask your AI assistant to create a codemod. Be specific about what you want to transform:

    ````
    Create a jssg codemod that converts all console.log statements to console.info in TypeScript files. 

    The codemod should:
    - Target .ts and .tsx files
    - Only transform console.log calls (not console.error, console.warn, etc.)
    - Preserve all arguments and formatting
    - Include test cases for the transformation
    ````

    You'll get a complete package structure:

    <Tree>
      <Tree.Folder name="my-codemod" defaultOpen>
        <Tree.File name="codemod.yaml" />
        <Tree.File name="workflow.yaml" />
        <Tree.Folder name="scripts" defaultOpen>
          <Tree.File name="codemod.ts" />
        </Tree.Folder>
        <Tree.Folder name="tests" defaultOpen>
          <Tree.Folder name="basic-transform" defaultOpen>
            <Tree.File name="input.tsx" />
            <Tree.File name="expected.tsx" />
          </Tree.Folder>
        </Tree.Folder>
      </Tree.Folder>
    </Tree>

    For more on package structure, see [Codemod Workflows](/workflows/building-workflows).

    **Need the live runner or AST viewer?**
    
    If you need tools like the live runner, AST viewer, or shareable links, you can bring your codemod into [Codemod Studio](https://go.codemod.com/studio) and continue development there. See [Codemod Studio guide](/platform/codemod-studio) for more.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate your codemod">
    Run tests to ensure your codemod works correctly:

    ```bash
    npx codemod jssg test ./scripts/codemod.ts --language tsx
    ```

    For test structure, CI integration, and debugging strategies, see [Testing](/jssg/testing).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Run your codemod">
    Run your codemod on a target codebase:

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow run -w ./my-codemod/ -t /path/to/your/project
    ```

    For all CLI options and running from the registry, see [CLI reference](/cli#codemod-workflow).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish your codemod">
    Share your codemod with your team or the community:

    ```bash
    npx codemod login
    npx codemod publish
    ```

    Your codemod is now in the [Codemod Registry](https://app.codemod.com/registry) and runnable via `npx codemod @codemod-name`.

    For CI/CD automation and more publishing features, see [Publishing guide](/publishing).
