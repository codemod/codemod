This guide takes you from zero to a published codemod. Each step includes just enough to get started, with links to deeper documentation.

## Building codemods

Codemods can be built using:
- **[MCP](/model-context-protocol)** — AI-assisted creation in your IDE (recommended for getting started)
- **[Studio](/platform/codemod-studio)** — Web-based prototyping with live runner and AST viewer
- **[Manually](/workflows/quickstart)** — Scaffold and build locally with `npx codemod init`

This guide walks through MCP. Once you have a codemod package, validation, running, and publishing work the same way regardless of how you built it.

## 1. Generate a codemod

Make sure you have [MCP installed](/model-context-protocol#quick-setup), then ask your AI assistant to create a codemod. Be specific about what you want to transform:

````
Create a jssg codemod that replaces React.Fragment tags with shorthand <> syntax.

Before:
```tsx
<React.Fragment>
  <Header />
  <Main />
</React.Fragment>
```

After:
```tsx
<>
  <Header />
  <Main />
</>
```

Requirements:
- Only transform fragments with no props (skip if key prop exists)
- Target .tsx files
- Include test cases
````

For more on writing effective prompts, see [MCP best practices](/model-context-protocol#best-practices).

You'll get a complete package structure:

```
my-codemod/
├── codemod.yaml        # Package metadata
├── workflow.yaml       # Workflow definition
├── scripts/
│   └── codemod.ts      # Your jssg transformation
└── tests/
    └── basic-transform/
        ├── input.tsx
        └── expected.tsx
```

For more on package structure, see [Building Workflows](/workflows/building-workflows).

### Need the live runner or AST viewer?

If you need tools like the live runner, AST viewer, or shareable links, you can bring your codemod into [Codemod Studio](https://go.codemod.com/studio) and continue development there. See [Codemod Studio guide](/platform/codemod-studio) for more.

## 2. Validate your codemod

Run tests to ensure your codemod works correctly:

```bash
npx codemod jssg test ./scripts/codemod.ts --language tsx
```

For test structure, CI integration, and debugging strategies, see [Testing](/jssg/testing).

## 3. Run your codemod

Run your codemod on a target codebase:

```bash
npx codemod workflow run -w ./my-codemod/ -t /path/to/your/project
```

For all CLI options and running from the registry, see [CLI reference](/cli#codemod-workflow).

## 4. Publish your codemod

Share your codemod with your team or the community:

```bash
npx codemod login
npx codemod publish
```

Your codemod is now in the [Codemod Registry](https://app.codemod.com/registry) and runnable via `npx codemod @codemod-name`.

For CI/CD automation and more publishing features, see [Publishing guide](/publishing).
