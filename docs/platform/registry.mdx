The **Codemod Registry** is a centralized repository for discovering, consuming, and distributing [Codemod packages](/package-structure). It enables the community to share reusable code transformation tools and allows organizations to maintain private codemods for their internal use. It provides:

- **Package discovery** – Search and browse codemods by language, framework, category, and keywords
- **Version management** – Semantic versioning with support for version pinning
- **Scoped packages** – Organize packages by organization or user scope (e.g., `@nodejs/create-require-from-path`)
- **Access control** – Configure codemod access types: `public` or `private`
- **Direct execution** – Run packages directly from the registry using `npx codemod <package-name>`

## Package Access Types

Codemod packages can have different access levels that control who can discover and run them:

### Public Access

Packages with `public` access are discoverable and runnable by anyone. They appear in public search results and can be used by the entire community.

**Use cases:**
- Community-shared codemods for open-source projects
- Framework migration tools for public use
- Educational or example codemods

**Features:**
- Free to use and publish
- Discoverable by everyone
- Browse at [codemod.com/registry](https://codemod.com/registry)

### Private Access

Packages with `private` access are only accessible to the owner or organization members. Available for Pro and Enterprise plan customers.

**Use cases:**
- Maintain proprietary codemods for company-specific patterns
- Share internal codemods across teams
- Keep sensitive transformations private
- Enforce organization standards

**Access:**
- Requires organization membership (for organization-scoped packages)
- Packages can be scoped to your organization (e.g., `@your-org/internal-codemod`)
- Configured through organization settings in the [Codemod app](https://app.codemod.com)

## Reserving an Organization Scope

To publish packages under your organization's scope (e.g., `@your-org/my-codemod`), you need to link your GitHub organization to Codemod platform. See [Linking Your GitHub Organization](/publishing#linking-your-github-organization) for step-by-step setup instructions.

## Discovering Packages

**Browse the Registry:**

Visit the [Codemod Registry](https://go.codemod.com/registry) web interface to browse packages.

**Search from CLI:**

Use the `codemod search` command to find packages:

```bash
# Search for packages
npx codemod search [query]
```

Learn more about search options in the [CLI Reference](/cli#codemod-search).

## Running Packages from the Registry

Run packages directly from the registry without downloading them first:

```bash
# Run a package (scoped or unscoped)
npx codemod @nodejs/create-require-from-path
```

<Info>
  When you run a package from the registry, Codemod CLI automatically downloads and caches it locally. Subsequent runs use the cached version for faster execution.
</Info>

**Version Pinning:**

For reproducible runs in production, always specify an exact version:

```bash
# Pin to specific version
npx codemod @nodejs/create-require-from-path@1.1.0

# Uses latest version (may change)
npx codemod @nodejs/create-require-from-path
```

Version pinning ensures your codemods behave consistently across different environments and over time.

## Publishing Packages

Publish your codemods to the registry to share them with others or use them across projects.

```bash
# 1. Create a codemod package
npx codemod init

# 2. Login to the registry
npx codemod login

# 3. Publish your codemod
npx codemod publish
```

### Configuring Access and Visibility

In your `codemod.yaml`, configure registry settings:

```yaml codemod.yaml
registry:
  access: "public"      # or "private"
  visibility: "public"  # or "private", "org", "user"
```

**Access levels:**
- `public` – Anyone can run the codemod
- `private` – Only the owner can run the codemod

<Info>
  Pro codemods are reserved for Codemod and their partners. To learn more, [contact the Codemod team](https://codemod.com/contact).
</Info>

**Visibility levels:**
- `public` – Everyone can see the package in search and listings
- `private` – Only the owner can see the package
- `org` – Members of the package's organization scope can see it
- `user` – Visible only to the publishing user

<Tip>
  Access and visibility work together. For example, `visibility: public` with `access: private` shows the package publicly, but only the owner can run it.
</Tip>

## Using Packages in Workflows

You can reference registry packages in your workflow definitions:

```yaml workflow.yaml
steps:
  - name: Run registry codemod
    codemod:
      source: "@nodejs/create-require-from-path@1.1.0"
```

## Best Practices

### Package Naming

- Use descriptive names that indicate the codemod's purpose
- Follow the naming convention: `/^[a-z0-9-_/]+$/`
- Include framework/library names when relevant

**When to use scoped package names:**

Use scoped package names (e.g., `@your-org/package-name`) when:
- **Framework or library maintainers** publishing official codemods for your project
- **Organizations or teams** publishing multiple related codemods that should be grouped together
- You want to **ensure only your organization** can publish codemods with that scope
- You need **better discoverability** for codemods from a specific organization or framework

For individual developers or one-off codemods, unscoped package names are usually the best choice.

### Versioning

- Follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) (MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Increment major version for breaking changes
- Increment minor version for new features
- Increment patch version for bug fixes

### Documentation

- Write clear descriptions in `codemod.yaml`
- Add relevant keywords for discoverability
- Include examples in your README
- Document any workflow parameters

### Testing

- Test your codemod thoroughly before publishing
- Use [jssg testing](/jssg/testing) for automated test cases
- Validate your workflow with `npx codemod workflow validate`
- Test with real codebases before publishing
