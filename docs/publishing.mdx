---

This guide covers all the ways to publish codemods to the [Codemod Registry](/platform/registry), from local development to automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Authentication Methods

Codemod supports three authentication methods for publishing:

| Method | Best For | Secrets Required | Setup |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------|
| [Interactive Login](#interactive-login) | Local development | None | None |
| [API Keys](#api-keys) | CI/CD pipelines, automation | Yes (`CODEMOD_API_KEY`) | Create key in UI |
| [Trusted Publishers](#trusted-publishers) | GitHub Actions, secure CI/CD | None (uses OIDC) | None for org scopes* |

<sub>* If your GitHub organization name matches your package scope, trusted publishing works automatically with zero configuration. See [Organization Scopes](#organization-scopes).</sub>

## Interactive Login

The simplest way to authenticate for local development. Opens a browser for OAuth authentication.

```bash
# Login to the registry
npx codemod login

# Verify authentication
npx codemod whoami
```

After logging in, you can publish packages:

```bash
npx codemod publish
```

### When to Use

- Local development and testing
- Quick one-off publishes
- When you prefer browser-based authentication

## API Keys

API keys allow non-interactive authentication, perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automation.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to [codemod.com/api-keys](https://go.codemod.com/api-keys)
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Actions - my-repo")
4. Select the permissions (typically "Publish Packages")
5. Copy the key (it won't be shown again)

### Using API Keys

**Option 1: Login with API key**

```bash
npx codemod login --api-key $CODEMOD_API_KEY
npx codemod publish
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**

```bash
CODEMOD_AUTH_TOKEN=$CODEMOD_API_KEY npx codemod publish
```

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Codemod Registry
        run: npx codemod login --api-key ${{ secrets.CODEMOD_API_KEY }}

      - name: Publish codemod
        run: npx codemod publish
```

<Warning>
  Store your API key as a repository secret. Never commit API keys to your repository.
</Warning>

### When to Use

- CI/CD pipelines without GitHub Actions OIDC
- GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, etc.
- Automated publishing from any environment
- When you need explicit control over credentials

## Trusted Publishers

Trusted publishers enable **passwordless publishing** from GitHub Actions using OpenID Connect (OIDC). No secrets to manage or rotate.

<Card title="How OIDC Works" icon="shield-check">
  GitHub Actions can request short-lived tokens that cryptographically prove the workflow's identity. Codemod verifies these tokens against your configured trusted publishers.
</Card>

### Benefits

- **No secrets to manage**: No API keys to create, rotate, or accidentally leak
- **Cryptographically secure**: Tokens are signed by GitHub and verified by Codemod
- **Fine-grained control**: Restrict publishing by repository, workflow, environment, or git ref
- **Short-lived tokens**: Tokens expire in ~5 minutes, limiting exposure

### Organization Scopes (Zero Configuration)

<Note>
  **This is the recommended approach for organizations.** If your GitHub organization name matches your package scope, trusted publishing works automatically with no UI configuration needed.
</Note>

For packages under an organization scope (e.g., `@my-org/my-codemod`), trusted publishers work **automatically** when:

1. Your GitHub organization name matches the package scope (e.g., GitHub org `my-org` → scope `@my-org`)
2. You've linked your GitHub organization (see [setup steps](#linking-your-github-organization) below)

Any repository in your GitHub organization can then publish packages under your scope, including new packages and updates to existing ones.

#### Linking Your GitHub Organization

To enable automatic trusted publishing for your organization scope, you need to install the Codemod GitHub App:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Codemod GitHub App">
    1. Install the [Codemod GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codemod) and select your GitHub organization (requires org admin permissions)
    2. Grant access to at least one repository
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sign in to Codemod">
    Go to [Codemod platform](https://app.codemod.com) and sign in with GitHub. Your organization will be automatically linked.
  </Step>
</Steps>

Once linked, anyone who can trigger GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., via push, release, or `workflow_dispatch`) in your organization's repositories can publish codemods under that scope. The publisher identity in Codemod's system is tied to the user who installed the GitHub App.

#### Complete GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a complete workflow file for publishing. You can create this manually or use `codemod init` to generate it automatically:

**For a single codemod repository:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"  # Triggers on tags like v1.0.0, v2.1.3, etc.

permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC token
  contents: read   # Required to checkout code

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Publish codemod
        uses: codemod/publish-action@v1
```

**For a monorepo with multiple codemods:**

If you have multiple codemods in a single repository (e.g., in a `codemods/` directory), use tags like `codemod-name@v1.0.0`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*@v*"  # Triggers on tags like my-codemod@v1.0.0

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Extract codemod name from tag
        id: extract
        run: |
          TAG="${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
          CODEMOD_NAME="${TAG%@v*}"
          echo "codemod_name=$CODEMOD_NAME" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Publish codemod
        uses: codemod/publish-action@v1
        with:
          path: codemods/${{ steps.extract.outputs.codemod_name }}
```

You can also run `npx codemod init` to generate this workflow automatically. It creates the single-codemod or monorepo format based on your project structure.

### Individual Packages (Manual Configuration)

For unscoped packages or cases where the GitHub org doesn't match the package scope, configure a trusted publisher manually:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Trusted Publisher in UI">
    1. Go to [codemod.com/api-keys](https://go.codemod.com/api-keys)
    2. Scroll to **Trusted Publishers**
    3. Click **Add Trusted Publisher**
    4. Select your package and enter the GitHub repository details
    5. (Optional) Add restrictions for extra security
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Workflow">
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/publish.yml
    name: Publish Codemod
    on:
      push:
        tags:
          - "v*"

    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for OIDC
      contents: read

    jobs:
      publish:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - uses: codemod/publish-action@v1
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Package | The package to publish to (required) | `my-codemod` or `@org/my-codemod` |
| Repository Owner | GitHub org or username | `my-org` |
| Repository Name | Repository name | `my-codemod-repo` |

Once configured, any workflow in that repository can publish to the specified package.

### Optional Restrictions

Add restrictions for additional security:

| Restriction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Workflow Path | Only allow specific workflow files | `.github/workflows/publish.yml` |
| Environment | Require GitHub Environment approval | `production` |
| Ref Pattern | Only allow specific git refs | `refs/tags/v*` |

**Example with restrictions:**

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Matches "Environment" restriction
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: codemod/publish-action@v1
```

### Manual OIDC Setup

If you prefer not to use the action, you can manually obtain and use the OIDC token:

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install codemod CLI
        run: npm install -g codemod@latest

      - name: Get OIDC token
        id: oidc
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const token = await core.getIDToken('https://codemod.com');
            core.setOutput('token', token);
            core.setSecret(token);

      - name: Publish codemod
        env:
          CODEMOD_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.oidc.outputs.token }}
        run: codemod publish
```

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No trusted publisher found">
    Verify your trusted publisher configuration matches:
    - Repository owner (case-insensitive)
    - Repository name (exact match)
    - Any configured restrictions (workflow path, environment, ref pattern)
    
    **For organization scopes:** Ensure the GitHub App is installed on at least one repository in your organization and you've signed in to Codemod with a GitHub account that has access to the organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    Ensure your workflow has the required permissions:
    ```yaml
    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for OIDC token
      contents: read   # Required to checkout code
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token audience mismatch">
    The OIDC token audience must be `https://codemod.com`. If using a custom registry, configure `GITHUB_OIDC_AUDIENCE` on the server.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
