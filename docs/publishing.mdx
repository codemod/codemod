---

This guide covers all the ways to publish codemods to the [Codemod Registry](/platform/registry), from local development to automated CI/CD pipelines.

## Authentication Methods

Codemod supports three authentication methods for publishing:

| Method | Best For | Secrets Required | Setup |
|--------|----------|------------------|-------|
| [Interactive Login](#interactive-login) | Local development | None | None |
| [API Keys](#api-keys) | CI/CD pipelines, automation | Yes (`CODEMOD_API_KEY`) | Create key in UI |
| [Trusted Publishers](#trusted-publishers) | GitHub Actions, secure CI/CD | None (uses OIDC) | None for org scopes* |

<sub>* If your GitHub organization name matches your package scope, trusted publishing works automatically with zero configuration. See [Organization Scopes](#organization-scopes-zero-configuration).</sub>

## Interactive Login

The simplest way to authenticate for local development. Opens a browser for OAuth authentication.

```bash
# Login to the registry
npx codemod login

# Verify authentication
npx codemod whoami
```

After logging in, you can publish packages:

```bash
npx codemod publish
```

### When to Use

- Local development and testing
- Quick one-off publishes
- When you prefer browser-based authentication

## API Keys

API keys allow non-interactive authentication, perfect for CI/CD pipelines and automation.

### Creating an API Key

1. Go to [codemod.com/api-keys](https://go.codemod.com/api-keys)
2. Click **Create API Key**
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "GitHub Actions - my-repo")
4. Select the permissions (typically "Publish Packages")
5. Copy the key (it won't be shown again)

### Using API Keys

**Option 1: Login with API key**

```bash
npx codemod login --api-key $CODEMOD_API_KEY
npx codemod publish
```

**Option 2: Environment variable**

```bash
CODEMOD_AUTH_TOKEN=$CODEMOD_API_KEY npx codemod publish
```

### GitHub Actions Example

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Login to Codemod Registry
        run: npx codemod login --api-key ${{ secrets.CODEMOD_API_KEY }}

      - name: Publish codemod
        run: npx codemod publish
```

<Warning>
  Store your API key as a repository secret. Never commit API keys to your repository.
</Warning>

### When to Use

- CI/CD pipelines without GitHub Actions OIDC
- GitLab CI, CircleCI, Jenkins, etc.
- Automated publishing from any environment
- When you need explicit control over credentials

## Trusted Publishers

Trusted publishers enable **passwordless publishing** from GitHub Actions using OpenID Connect (OIDC). No secrets to manage or rotate.

<Card title="How OIDC Works" icon="shield-check">
  GitHub Actions can request short-lived tokens that cryptographically prove the workflow's identity. Codemod verifies these tokens against your configured trusted publishers.
</Card>

### Benefits

- **No secrets to manage** – No API keys to create, rotate, or accidentally leak
- **Cryptographically secure** – Tokens are signed by GitHub and verified by Codemod
- **Fine-grained control** – Restrict by repository, workflow, environment, or git ref
- **Short-lived tokens** – Tokens expire in ~5 minutes, limiting exposure

### Organization Scopes (Zero Configuration)

<Note>
  **This is the recommended approach for organizations.** If your GitHub organization name matches your package scope, trusted publishing works automatically with no UI configuration needed.
</Note>

For packages under an organization scope (e.g., `@my-org/my-codemod`), trusted publishers work **automatically** when:

1. Your GitHub organization name matches the package scope (e.g., GitHub org `my-org` → scope `@my-org`)
2. You've linked your GitHub organization to your Codemod organization (see [setup steps](#linking-your-github-organization) below)

That's it. Any repository in your GitHub organization can publish packages under your scope—both new packages and updates to existing ones.

#### Linking Your GitHub Organization

To enable automatic trusted publishing for your organization scope, you need to install the Codemod GitHub App:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Install the Codemod GitHub App">
    1. Go to [github.com/apps/codemod](https://github.com/apps/codemod)
    2. Click **Install**
    3. Select your GitHub organization
    4. Choose which repositories to grant access to (at least one repository is required)
    5. Click **Install**
    
    <Warning>
      You must be a GitHub organization **admin** to install the app. The app needs to be installed on at least one repository in your organization to link the org.
    </Warning>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Sign in to Codemod">
    1. Go to [codemod.com](https://codemod.com) and sign in with GitHub
    2. Your GitHub organization will be automatically linked to your Codemod account
    3. You can verify the link at [codemod.com/organizations](https://go.codemod.com/organizations)
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Verify the Setup">
    Once linked, you can publish packages under your organization's scope (e.g., `@your-org/codemod-name`) from any repository in that GitHub organization using GitHub Actions OIDC.
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Info>
  **Who can publish?** Anyone who can trigger GitHub Actions workflows (e.g., via push, release, or `workflow_dispatch`) in any repository within the linked GitHub organization can publish codemods under that organization's scope. The publisher identity in Codemod's system is the user who originally installed the GitHub App and linked the organization.
</Info>

#### Complete GitHub Actions Workflow

Here's a complete workflow file for publishing. You can create this manually or use `codemod init` to generate it automatically:

**For a single codemod repository:**

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "v*"  # Triggers on tags like v1.0.0, v2.1.3, etc.

permissions:
  id-token: write  # Required for OIDC token
  contents: read   # Required to checkout code

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      
      - name: Publish codemod
        uses: codemod-com/publish-action@v1
```

**For a monorepo with multiple codemods:**

If you have multiple codemods in a single repository (e.g., in a `codemods/` directory), use tags like `codemod-name@v1.0.0`:

```yaml
# .github/workflows/publish.yml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  push:
    tags:
      - "*@v*"  # Triggers on tags like my-codemod@v1.0.0

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Extract codemod name from tag
        id: extract
        run: |
          TAG="${GITHUB_REF#refs/tags/}"
          CODEMOD_NAME="${TAG%@v*}"
          echo "codemod_name=$CODEMOD_NAME" >> $GITHUB_OUTPUT

      - name: Publish codemod
        uses: codemod-com/publish-action@v1
        with:
          path: codemods/${{ steps.extract.outputs.codemod_name }}
```

<Tip>
  **Using `codemod init`:** When you run `npx codemod init` and answer "Yes" to creating a GitHub Actions workflow, it will generate the appropriate `publish.yml` file for you. The generated workflow uses the single-codemod format by default, or the monorepo format if you're initializing within an existing monorepo structure.
</Tip>

**Example:** If your GitHub organization is `acme-corp` and you've linked it to your Codemod organization with scope `@acme-corp`:

This workflow can publish `@acme-corp/any-codemod` from any repository in the `acme-corp` GitHub organization.

### Individual Packages (Manual Configuration)

<Warning>
  **Most users don't need this section.** If your GitHub organization name matches your package scope (e.g., GitHub org `acme` publishing `@acme/my-codemod`), use the [Organization Scopes](#organization-scopes-zero-configuration) approach above—no manual configuration required.
</Warning>

For packages that don't match an organization scope (unscoped packages or packages where the GitHub org doesn't match), you need to configure a trusted publisher manually in the UI:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Configure Trusted Publisher in UI">
    1. Go to [codemod.com/api-keys](https://go.codemod.com/api-keys)
    2. Scroll to **Trusted Publishers**
    3. Click **Add Trusted Publisher**
    4. Fill in the required fields:
       - **Package**: The exact package name you want to publish (e.g., `my-codemod`)
       - **Repository Owner**: Your GitHub username or organization name
       - **Repository Name**: The repository that will publish this package
    5. (Optional) Add restrictions for extra security
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure Your Workflow">
    ```yaml
    # .github/workflows/publish.yml
    name: Publish Codemod
    on:
      push:
        tags:
          - "v*"

    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for OIDC
      contents: read

    jobs:
      publish:
        runs-on: ubuntu-latest
        steps:
          - uses: actions/checkout@v4
          - uses: codemod-com/publish-action@v1
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

| Field | Description | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|
| Package | The package to publish to (required) | `my-codemod` or `@org/my-codemod` |
| Repository Owner | GitHub org or username | `my-org` |
| Repository Name | Repository name | `my-codemod-repo` |

Once configured, any workflow in that repository can publish to the specified package.

### Optional Restrictions

Add restrictions for additional security:

| Restriction | Description | Example |
|-------------|-------------|---------|
| Workflow Path | Only allow specific workflow files | `.github/workflows/publish.yml` |
| Environment | Require GitHub Environment approval | `production` |
| Ref Pattern | Only allow specific git refs | `refs/tags/v*` |

**Example with restrictions:**

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    environment: production  # Matches "Environment" restriction
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: codemod-com/publish-action@v1
```

### Manual OIDC Setup

If you prefer not to use the action, you can manually obtain and use the OIDC token:

```yaml
name: Publish Codemod
on:
  release:
    types: [published]

permissions:
  id-token: write
  contents: read

jobs:
  publish:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Setup Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v4
        with:
          node-version: '20'

      - name: Install codemod CLI
        run: npm install -g codemod@latest

      - name: Get OIDC token
        id: oidc
        uses: actions/github-script@v7
        with:
          script: |
            const token = await core.getIDToken('https://codemod.com');
            core.setOutput('token', token);
            core.setSecret(token);

      - name: Publish codemod
        env:
          CODEMOD_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{ steps.oidc.outputs.token }}
        run: codemod publish
```

### Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="No trusted publisher found">
    Verify your trusted publisher configuration matches:
    - Repository owner (case-insensitive)
    - Repository name (exact match)
    - Any configured restrictions (workflow path, environment, ref pattern)
    
    **For organization scopes:** Ensure the GitHub App is installed on at least one repository in your organization and you've signed in to Codemod with a GitHub account that has access to the organization.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Permission denied">
    Ensure your workflow has the required permissions:
    ```yaml
    permissions:
      id-token: write  # Required for OIDC token
      contents: read   # Required to checkout code
    ```
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Token audience mismatch">
    The OIDC token audience must be `https://codemod.com`. If using a custom registry, configure `GITHUB_OIDC_AUDIENCE` on the server.
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="GitHub organization not linked">
    To use automatic organization scope publishing:
    1. Install the [Codemod GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codemod) on your organization (requires admin permissions)
    2. Grant access to at least one repository
    3. Sign in to [codemod.com](https://codemod.com) with GitHub
    4. Verify the link at [codemod.com/organizations](https://go.codemod.com/organizations)
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Workflow generated by `codemod init` looks different from docs">
    The `codemod init` command generates different workflows depending on your setup:
    
    - **Single codemod repo**: Generates a workflow triggered by `v*` tags
    - **Monorepo**: Generates a workflow triggered by `*@v*` tags (e.g., `my-codemod@v1.0.0`) with an extraction step to determine which codemod to publish
    
    Both use the same underlying `codemod-com/publish-action` and are functionally equivalent—just optimized for different project structures.
