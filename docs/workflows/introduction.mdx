**Codemod Workflows** is an execution engine that orchestrates automated code transformations at scale. It schedules, runs, and coordinates codemods across files, repositories, and teams.

## How workflows work

A workflow is defined in `workflow.yaml` and consists of **nodes** that execute in a dependency-aware order. Each node contains **steps**—atomic actions that perform transformations or run commands.

The engine handles:
- **Scheduling**: Determines execution order based on node dependencies
- **Parallelization**: Runs independent nodes concurrently via matrix strategies
- **State management**: Persists progress for resumable, interruptible migrations
- **Coordination**: Synchronizes work across shards, teams, or repositories

## Core concepts

### Nodes

Nodes are the primary execution units. They can depend on other nodes, run automatically or require manual approval, and fan out across matrix dimensions.

### Steps

Steps are the atomic actions within a node. Different transformation challenges require different tools: some patterns are best expressed as AST queries, others need shell scripts for setup/teardown, and ambiguous cases may benefit from LLM assistance.

By composing multiple step types in a single workflow, teams can tackle complex refactors while decreasing reliance on manual intervention or multiple disconnected scripts.

| Step Type | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| `js-ast-grep` | JavaScript/TypeScript codemods using [JSSG](/jssg) |
| `ast-grep` | Declarative YAML pattern matching |
| `run` | Shell commands for setup, cleanup, or external tools |
| `ai` | LLM-powered transformations for complex or ambiguous cases |
| `codemod` | Run codemods from [Codemod Registry](https://go.codemod.com/registry) |

### Matrix strategies

Matrix strategies fan out a single node into multiple parallel tasks. Use them for:
- Sharding work by team or directory
- Running transforms across multiple configurations
- Distributing load across repositories

### State

Workflows can declare shared state that persists across runs. This enables:
- Resuming interrupted migrations
- Coordinating work across repositories
- Tracking progress for large-scale refactors

### Parameters

Parameters make workflows configurable and reusable. Define a schema in your workflow, then pass values at runtime or configure them visually in the Codemod app.

## Package structure

A Codemod package bundles everything needed to run a workflow: metadata, workflow definition, transformation scripts, and test fixtures.
