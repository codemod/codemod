Codemod provides tools and infra to deploy task-specific codemods or micro-agents (a workflow comprised of codemods and AI) to automate any repetitive or large scale codebase remediation end to end, from planning, to reliable transformations, to orchestrating changes across teams, to easy and safe deployments across repos, to tracking and leadership dashboard.

## Use cases
- End-of-life framework and SDK upgrades (React, Nuxt, etc.)
- Large-scale API migrations and deprecations
- Security and compliance patches across fleets of services
- Dependency consistency, lint fixes, and other sweeping chores
- Internationalization (i18n) rollouts and other cross-cutting mandates
- Tech unification after M&A or platform consolidation (CommonJS → ESM/TS)
- Infrastructure migrations (RDS → DynamoDB, on-prem → cloud)
