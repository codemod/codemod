Codemod provides tools and infrastructure to automate repetitive or large-scale codebase remediation from end to end. You can deploy task-specific codemods or micro-agents—workflows that combine codemods and AI—to handle complex migrations and upgrades. Codemod supports every stage of the process: planning, reliable code transformations, orchestrating changes across teams, safe deployments across repositories, and tracking progress with leadership dashboards.

## Use cases
- End-of-life framework and SDK upgrades (React, Nuxt, etc.)
- Large-scale API migrations and deprecations
- Security and compliance patches across fleets of services
- Dependency consistency, lint fixes, and other sweeping chores
- Internationalization (i18n) rollouts and other cross-cutting mandates
- Tech unification after M&A or platform consolidation (CommonJS → ESM/TS)
- Infrastructure migrations (RDS → DynamoDB, on-prem → cloud)
