Codemod provides tools and infra to deploy task-specific codemods or micro-agents (a workflow comprised of codemods and AI) to automate any repetitive or large scale codebase remediation end to end, from planning, to reliable transformations, to orchestrating changes across teams, to easy and safe deployments across repos, to tracking and leadership dashboard.

## Use cases
- End-of-life framework and SDK upgrades (React, Nuxt, etc.)
- Large-scale API migrations and deprecations
- Security and compliance patches across fleets of services
- Dependency consistency, lint fixes, and other sweeping chores
- Internationalization (i18n) rollouts and other cross-cutting mandates
- Tech unification after M&A or platform consolidation (CommonJS → ESM/TS)
- Infrastructure migrations (RDS → DynamoDB, on-prem → cloud)

### Enterprise
1. Platform teams
2. I18n engineers
3. Security engineers
4. Tech leads
5. Engineering leaders and CTOs

### OSS & frameworks
1. Framework/library builders — ship one-click upgrade recipes to your users. See the OSS path in `OSS & Community`.

The platform stands on two complementary foundations:

* **Open-source toolkit** – free CLI and public registry maintained by the community, ensuring migrations stay current and battle-tested.
* **Enterprise capabilities** – Studio, Campaigns, Insights, and private registries that add creation, orchestration, and governance for larger engineering orgs.

Community-powered migrations, paired with enterprise-grade automation, make Codemod the gold standard for keeping codebases up to date.

### Open-source building blocks

* **[CLI](/cli/cli-reference)** – build, run, & publish Codemod packages
* **[Codemod MCP](/model-context-protocol)** – build Codemod packages with AI in IDEs
* **[Public Registry](https://codemod.com/registry)** – discover community-led codemods

### Enterprise & engineering teams' features

<Note>
  The following capabilities are available on the [Pro and Enterprise tiers](https://codemod.com/pricing).
</Note>

* **[Studio](/codemod-studio)** – AI-generated codemods & recipes
* **[Campaigns](/campaigns)** – run and orchestrate changes at scale
* **[Insights](/insights)** – plan and track fleet-wide progress
* **Private / Pro Registry** – secure, organization-scoped codemods
