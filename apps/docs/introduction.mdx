Codemod provides tools and infrastructure to automate repetitive or large-scale codebase remediation from end to end. You can deploy task-specific codemods or micro-agents—workflows that combine codemods and AI—to handle complex migrations and upgrades. Codemod supports every stage of the process: planning, reliable code transformations, orchestrating changes across teams, safe deployments across repositories, and tracking progress with leadership dashboards.
