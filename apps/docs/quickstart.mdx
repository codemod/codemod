## Run your first codemod

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Discovered a Codemod package from the registry
- Created a Campaign that runs the Codemod package on your repository
- Received a pull request with valuable code changes

<Steps>
  <Step title="Discover a Codemod package in the Registry">
    Browse [Codemod Registry](https://go.codemod.com/registry) to find codemods for your use case.
    
    The registry includes Codemod packages for framework upgrades, security patches, API migrations, code modernization patterns, and [more](/introduction#what-codemod-helps-you-solve).
  </Step>

  <Step title="Apply a Codemod package to your repository">
    Once you've found a Codemod package you want to try:
    
    1. Click **Apply to Repository**
    2. You'll be prompted to create a new Campaign using the package you selected
    3. If you're not signed in, you'll be prompted to sign in (GitHub, GitLab, or SSO)

    <Tip>
      To run a codemod without signing in, use the [CLI](/cli). Each Codemod package's registry page includes a copy-able command you can run locally.

      CLI execution is great for local testing and one-off transformations. Campaigns provide centralized tracking, multi-repo orchestration, and team collaboration features.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the GitHub or GitLab App (if needed)">
    To run Campaigns on your repositories, Codemod needs access via the GitHub or GitLab integrations. If you haven't installed either one, you'll be prompted during Campaign creation.

    <Warning>
      If the user requesting installation isn't an organization admin, they may see an error. Ask an organization admin to approve the installation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure and run your Campaign">
    In the Campaign creation flow:
    
    1. **Select target repository**
    2. **Configure parameters** (if the codemod supports them)
    3. **Name your Campaign**
    4. **Review**, **Create**, and **Run** your Campaign
    
    <Check>
      The Campaign will create a pull request with the code changes. You'll receive a notification when the PR is ready to review.
