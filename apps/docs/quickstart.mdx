This guide helps engineering leaders and progressive enterprise teams set up Codemod Platform to automate and track large-scale code transformations across your organization.

## Getting started

By the end of this guide, you'll have:
- Set up your Codemod organization with GitHub/GitLab integration
- Created a Campaign to orchestrate migrations across repositories
- Set up Insights dashboards to track progress
- Invited team members and configured permissions

<Steps>
  <Step title="Sign up and create your organization">
    [Sign in to Codemod](https://app.codemod.com) using GitHub, GitLab, or SSO.

    Then create an organization for your team:

    1. Click on the team switcher and select **"Add Organization"**
    2. Choose your Git provider (GitHub or GitLab)
    3. Enter your organization details
  </Step>

  <Step title="Install the GitHub or GitLab App">
    Connect Codemod to your repositories by installing the integration:

      <Card title="GitHub" icon="github" href="/integrations/github">
        Install the Codemod GitHub App
      </Card>
      <Card title="GitLab" icon="gitlab" href="/integrations/gitlab">
        Set up group access tokens
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>

    <Warning>
      If the user requesting installation isn't an organization admin, they may see an error. Ask an organization admin to approve the installation.
    </Warning>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Create your first Campaign">
    Campaigns let you orchestrate code transformations across multiple repositories with centralized tracking and state management.

    **1. Choose a Codemod package:**
    
    When creating a Campaign, you can select from several Codemod package options:
    
     <Card title="Pro codemods" icon="pro">
        Pre-built, enterprise-grade transformations available to <a href="https://codemod.com/pricing" target="_blank">Pro and Enterprise plan</a> customers. These are tailored to your codebase by Codemod experts for complex use cases and patterns.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Build your own" icon="wrench">
        Create your own custom Codemod package manually or with AI assistance using <a href="/model-context-protocol">Codemod MCP</a> or <a href="/codemod-studio">Codemod Studio</a>.
    </Card>
    <Card title="Public registry" icon="globe">
        Browse and use community Codemod packages from <a href="https://go.codemod.com/registry" target="_blank">Codemod Registry</a>.
    </Card>

    **2. Create a Campaign:**
    1. Navigate to [Campaigns → Create Campaign](https://app.codemod.com/workflows/create/registry)
    2. Select a Codemod package
    3. Choose target repositories
    4. Configure campaign parameters (if the package supports them)
    5. Click **Run** to start the Campaign

  </Step>

  <Step title="Set up Insights dashboards">
    Codemod Insights helps you track migration progress, identify modernization opportunities, and measure the impact of code transformations across your codebase.

    **Create your first dashboard:**
    1. Go to [Insights → Create Dashboard](https://app.codemod.com/insights)
    2. Create a dashboard for a specific migration or initiative (e.g., "React 18 Migration", "Security Updates", "i18n Migration")
    3. Add widgets to track patterns.

    **Configure widgets:**
    - Define queries using [ast-grep YAML rules](https://ast-grep.github.io/reference/yaml.html)
    - Generate rules easily with [Codemod Studio](/codemod-studio#using-codemod-ai)
    - Track patterns like API usage, deprecated patterns, or adoption metrics

  </Step>

  <Step title="Invite team members and configure permissions">
    Add team members to your organization to collaborate on migrations:

    1. Go to **Organization Settings** → **Members**
    2. Click **Invite Members**
    3. Enter email addresses and assign roles:
       - **Admin**: Full access to organization settings and features
       - **Member**: Can create and manage Campaigns, view Insights
       - **Viewer**: Read-only access to Campaigns and Insights

    <Tip>
      Configure GitHub organization role synchronization if you're using GitHub. This automatically syncs team member roles from your GitHub organization.
    </Tip>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Advanced Enterprise Features

Once you're comfortable with the basics, explore these enterprise capabilities to scale your migrations:

<Card title="Private Registry" icon="lock" href="/registry#private-access">
Publish organization-specific codemods accessible only to your team. Maintain internal codemods for proprietary patterns, standards, and company-specific transformations.
