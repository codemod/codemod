**Codemod Workflowsâ€”now production-ready:** Complete overhaul of our workflow automation platform with manual task triggering, real-time cancellation, parameter editing during runs, and smart encryption for sensitive data. Run campaigns at scale with confidence.

**Insights dashboardsâ€”more powerful:** Duplicate widgets and entire dashboards with one click, archive old analytics, and leverage multi-query widgets to combine data sources. Table views make large datasets easier to navigate.

**GitLab integration:** Full GitLab support joins GitHubâ€”browse all your groups and repositories, infinite scrolling through large orgs, and webhook integration for automated workflows.

**Project management integrations:**
- Jira bidirectional sync keeps your tasks aligned across platforms
- GitHub organization role synchronization
- Automatic task status updates and assignment tracking

**Codemod Studio enhancements:**
- **GitHub-style diffs:** Beautiful syntax-highlighted side-by-side comparisons powered by Shiki
- **Restore checkpoints:** Easily revert to previous versions of your code transformations
- **Pro codemods:** Premium transformations now available with team subscriptions

**Stripe-powered subscriptions:** Seamless billing management directly in organization settings, with pro plan access controls for premium features and enterprise codemods.

**jssg security & capabilities:** jssg now enforces a deny-by-default security model. File system access, network requests, and process spawning are disabled by default and must be explicitly enabled via the `capabilities` field in `codemod.yaml` or CLI flags. This ensures untrusted codemods cannot access sensitive resources without explicit permission, providing better security and auditability.

**Platform upgrades:**
- Next.js 16 and React 19 for improved performance and developer experience
- Enhanced authentication flows and session handling

**UX & design polish:**
- Refined theme toggle with better dark mode support
- Improved mobile experience across registry and studio
- Breadcrumb navigation in package details
- Streamlined repository selection with search and infinite scroll
- Cleaner task cards and status indicators
