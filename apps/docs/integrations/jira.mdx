Connect Codemod to your Jira workspace to sync issues with your projects and automatically track progress of your code transformation campaigns.

## Why Integrate Jira?

Integrating Codemod with Jira allows you to:
- Link code transformation projects to Jira epics for tracking
- Automatically sync task progress between Codemod and Jira
- Trigger codemods based on Jira issue updates

## Setting Up the Integration

### Step 1: Navigate to Organization Settings

Sign in to [Codemod](https://app.codemod.com) and navigate to your organization settings:

1. Select your organization from the team switcher
2. Go to **Settings** from the organization menu
3. Scroll down to the **Project Management Integrations** section

### Step 2: Connect Jira

Click the **"Connect Jira"** button to begin the integration process.

### Step 3: Create a Jira API Token

Before proceeding, you'll need to create an Atlassian API token:

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Atlassian Account Settings">
  Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens) and sign in to your account.
</Step>

<Step title="Create API Token">
  1. Click **"Create API token"**
  2. Enter a label (e.g., "Codemod Integration")
  3. Click **"Create"**
  4. Copy the generated token immediately

  <Warning>
  Make sure to copy the token right away. Atlassian will only show it once for security reasons.
  </Warning>
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 4: Configure Jira Integration

Fill in the Jira integration form with your workspace details:

<ParamField body="baseUrl" type="string" required>
Your Jira Cloud instance URL (e.g., https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="email" type="string" required>
The email address associated with your Jira account
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="apiToken" type="string" required>
The API token you created in the previous step
</ParamField>

<ParamField body="webhookSecret" type="string">
Optional webhook secret for validating webhook signatures (recommended for security)
</ParamField>

Click **"Connect Jira"** to complete the initial setup.

## Webhook Configuration (Recommended)

Webhooks allow Codemod to receive real-time updates when Jira issues change. This is optional but recommended for the best experience.

### Step 1: Access Webhook Settings

After connecting Jira, you'll see webhook configuration options in your organization settings:

1. Find your connected Jira integration in the settings
2. Click the **webhook icon** to configure webhooks

    title="Screenshot showing the link button in project header"
    className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"58%" }}
  />
</Step>

<Step title="Select Jira workspace">
  If you have multiple PM integrations, select your Jira workspace from the provider dropdown.
</Step>

<Step title="Search and select epic">
  1. Search for your Jira project or epic by typing in the search field
  2. Select the appropriate Jira project from the dropdown
  3. The format will show: `PROJECT-KEY - Project Name`

    title="Screenshot of project linking modal with Jira project selection"
    className="block dark:hidden mx-auto"
    style={{ width:"58%" }}
  />
</Step>

<Step title="Confirm linking">
  Click **"Link Project"** to establish the connection between your Codemod campaign and the Jira epic.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Viewing Linked Projects

Once linked, you'll see the connection status in your project:

- **Linked projects** display the Jira project key and name
- **Status sync** shows progress updates from Jira
- **Quick access** provides direct links to the associated Jira epic

## Required Permissions

Your Jira API token needs the following permissions:

**Read** access to:
- Projects and project configurations
- Issues and issue metadata
- User information

**Write** access to:
- Issues (to sync status updates)
- Comments (for progress notifications)

<Info>
These permissions are typically included with standard Jira user accounts. Admin permissions are not required.
</Info>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Authentication failed">
- Verify your Jira base URL is correct (should be https://your-domain.atlassian.net)
- Check that your email matches your Jira account email exactly
- Ensure your API token is valid and hasn't expired
- Try generating a new API token from Atlassian
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Cannot find projects when linking">
- Confirm you have access to the Jira projects you're trying to link
- Check that the projects exist in the Jira workspace you connected
- Verify your API token has read access to the specific projects
- Try refreshing the project list or searching with different terms
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Webhooks not working">
- Verify the webhook URL is correctly configured in Jira
- Check that the webhook is enabled in Jira settings
- Ensure the webhook secret matches between Jira and Codemod (if used)
- Confirm that issue events are selected in the Jira webhook configuration
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Status sync issues">
- Check that webhooks are properly configured and enabled
- Verify network connectivity between Jira and Codemod
- Ensure your API token has write access to update issues
- Try unlinking and relinking the project
</Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Security Considerations

<Warning>
Keep your Jira API token secure and never share it publicly or commit it to version control.
</Warning>

- **Token Security**: All API tokens are encrypted at rest and in transit using industry-standard encryption
- **Webhook Validation**: Use webhook secrets to validate incoming requests from Jira
- **Minimal Access**: Only grant the minimum required permissions for your integration needs
- **Regular Rotation**: Consider rotating API tokens regularly for enhanced security
- **Access Review**: Regularly review which projects and issues have access in your Jira workspace

## Managing the Integration

To disconnect or modify the Jira integration:

1. Go to **Organization Settings** ‚Üí **Project Management Integrations**
2. Find your Jira integration and click **"Disconnect"** or the configure buttons

To revoke access from Jira's side:

1. Go to [Atlassian API Tokens](https://id.atlassian.com/manage-profile/security/api-tokens)
2. Find the Codemod token and click **"Delete"**
