Codemod provides infrastructure for framework and library maintainers to build, test, and distribute automated migrations. When you ship breaking changes, codemods help your users upgrade by eliminating the repetitive, mechanical parts of migration, reducing the effort that keeps them stuck on old versions.

Users on outdated versions create ongoing costs:
- security vulnerabilities go unpatched
- bug reports duplicate issues already fixed upstream
- community support fragments across versions

Codemods address this by making upgrades less painful.

## What Codemod enables

- **Eliminate repetitive migration work** - Codemods handle mechanical changes like renaming APIs, updating imports, and refactoring patterns. Your users focus on the parts that require human judgment.
- **Handle real-world complexity** - Migrations aren't always simple. [Workflows](/cli/packages/building-workflows) supports [multiple step types](/cli/packages/building-workflows#steps), [manual approval gates](/cli/packages/building-workflows#manual-trigger) for human intervention, and [AI-assisted steps](/cli/packages/building-workflows#ai-step) for non-deterministic tasks.
- **Distribute through a central registry** - Publish codemods to the [Codemod Registry](/registry) where users discover and run them via CLI or IDE.

## How it works

1. **[Write codemods](/cli/packages/quickstart)** that automate breaking changes using jssg, YAML rules, or multi-step workflows
2. **[Publish to the registry](/publishing)** under your framework's namespace using the CLI or CI/CD
3. **Users run them** with a single [CLI](/cli/cli-reference) command or through [Codemod platform](/campaigns)

## Getting started

Codemods can be built using:
- **[CLI](/cli/cli-reference)** - Scaffold and build locally with `npx codemod init`
- **[MCP](/model-context-protocol)** - AI-assisted creation in your IDE
- **[Studio](/codemod-studio)** - Web-based prototyping with Codemod AI

This guide uses the CLI. The workflow is the same regardless of how you create the codemod.

### Build your first codemod

import { MigrationsTemplateDemo } from "/snippets/migrations-template-demo.mdx";

<Frame>
  <MigrationsTemplateDemo />
</Frame>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Scaffold a new package">
    ```bash
    npx codemod init
    ```

    The CLI walks you through setup:
    - **Codemod type** - jssg (simple transforms) or multi-step workflow (complex migrations)
    - **Target language** - TypeScript, JavaScript, Python, etc.
    - **Package name** - Use `@your-framework/codemod-name` for scoped packages

    This creates a folder with the required structure:

    ```plaintext
    my-codemod/
    ├── codemod.yaml        # Package metadata
    ├── workflow.yaml       # Workflow definition
    └── scripts/
        └── codemod.ts      # Your transformation logic
    ```
  </Step>

  <Step title="Write your transformation">
    Open `scripts/codemod.ts` and write your transformation. Here's a minimal example that replaces `console.log` with `logger.log`:

    ```ts scripts/codemod.ts
    import type { Transform } from "codemod:ast-grep";
    import type TSX from "codemod:ast-grep/langs/tsx";

    const transform: Transform<TSX> = (root) => {
      const node = root.root();
      const matches = node.findAll({ pattern: "console.log($$$ARGS)" });

      if (matches.length === 0) return null;

      const edits = matches.map((match) => {
        const args = match.getMultipleMatches("ARGS").map(a => a.text()).join(", ");
        return match.replace(`logger.log(${args})`);
      });

      return node.commitEdits(edits);
    };

    export default transform;
    ```

    See the [jssg quickstart](/jssg/quickstart) for patterns and API details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Test locally">
    Run your codemod against a target directory:

    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow run -w ./my-codemod/ -t ./path/to/test-repo --dry-run
    ```

    The `--dry-run` flag shows what changes would be made without applying them.

    For automated testing, create input/expected fixtures:

    ```plaintext
    tests/
      basic-case/
        input.ts       # Before
        expected.ts    # After
    ```

    Then run:

    ```bash
    npx codemod jssg test ./scripts/codemod.ts -l tsx
    ```

    See [testing documentation](/jssg/testing) for more options.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Publish to the registry

Once your codemod works locally, publish it so your users can run it.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Login">
    ```bash
    npx codemod login
    ```

    This opens a browser for authentication. You can sign in with GitHub, GitLab, or SSO.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Publish">
    ```bash
    npx codemod publish
    ```

    Your codemod is now live in the [Codemod Registry](https://go.codemod.com/registry). Users can run it with:

    ```bash
    npx codemod @your-framework/codemod-name
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>

<Tip>
  Use [scoped package names](/registry#package-naming) (e.g., `@nuxt/v3-to-v4`) to group codemods under your framework's namespace.
</Tip>

### CI/CD and automation

For ongoing codemod development, use the [migrations template](https://github.com/codemod/migrations-template) to get a ready-to-use repository with GitHub Actions for validation and publishing.

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create your codemods repository">
    Fork or use the [migrations template](https://github.com/codemod/migrations-template) in your GitHub organization.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Link your organization">
    1. [Sign in](https://app.codemod.com) to Codemod
    2. [Create an organization](https://app.codemod.com/global/organizations/create) matching your GitHub org name
    3. Install the [Codemod GitHub App](https://github.com/apps/codemod)
    
    This enables [trusted publishing](/publishing#trusted-publishers)—passwordless publishing from GitHub Actions with no API keys to manage.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Configure your workflow">
    For trusted publishing, ensure your workflow has OIDC permissions:
    
    ```yaml
    permissions:
      id-token: write
      contents: read

    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: codemod/publish-action@v1
    ```
    
    <Tip>
      Prefer API keys instead? [Create one](https://app.codemod.com/api-keys) and add it as a repository secret named `CODEMOD_API_KEY`. See [publishing](/publishing) for all options.
    </Tip>
  </Step>

  <Step title="Push and publish">
    Add codemods to your repository. The GitHub Action validates on PR and publishes on release.
  </Step>
</Steps>
