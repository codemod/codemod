Migration Campaigns enable engineering teams to orchestrate sweeping code changes—framework upgrades, API refactors, or dependency clean-ups—across any number of repositories.

By combining Codemod's AI-powered runbooks with deterministic automations, campaigns dramatically lower migration costs and risk while giving you full visibility into progress.

<Info>
  Migration Campaigns are designed for enterprise engineering teams. To start a new migration campaign, simply [contact us](https://go.codemod.com/contact) and we'll add a demo of the requested migration to your dashboard. See [i18n migrations](https://codemod.com/i18n) for real-world examples of enterprise campaigns.

## Before you start: plan with Insights

Use **[Codemod Insights](/insights)** dashboards to measure how widespread a pattern is, estimate effort, and decide which repositories to include in your campaign. Once priorities are clear, spin up a new migration campaign and execute with confidence.

## Running a Migration Campaign

[Codemod campaigns](https://app.codemod.com/projects) provide:

- **Visual parameter configuration** - Edit workflow parameters through the UI instead of YAML
- **Centralized state management** - Coordinate migrations with persistent state across repos and teams  
- **Multi-repo orchestration** - Run workflows across your entire codebase with progress tracking
- **Business insights** - Track migration progress with custom metrics and dashboards

<Tip>
  Make sure the <a href="https://github.com/apps/codemod">Codemod GitHub App</a> is installed on repositories you plan to migrate.
</Tip>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create a campaign">
    Navigate to **[Campaigns -> Create Campaign](https://app.codemod.com/workflows/create/registry)** in the Codemod app.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Configure campaign details">
    Configure:
    - **Codemod Package** – The codemod package that you want to run. This can be an existing package, a custom pro codemod (for enterprise customers), or one you create yourself. You can build codemod packages using Codemod MCP or Studio.
    - **Target Repository** – The repository that you want to run the codemod package on.
    - **Campaign Name & Description** – Give your campaign a descriptive name and description.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Run & track">
    Click **Run** to initiate the campaign.
    
    Each campaign defines one or more steps that Codemod will run for the target repository. Codemod opens pull requests, tracks status, and surfaces metrics so you always know what's left.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Creating custom workflows

While a campaign may be as simple as a single automated codemod, most migrations involve a sequence of steps. You can design those steps by building [codemod workflows](/cli/workflows). Pro and enterprise customers can request custom workflows.
