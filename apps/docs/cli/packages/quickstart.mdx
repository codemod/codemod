  <Step title="Create a new codemod package">
    ```bash
    npx codemod init
    ```

    When creating a new codemod project, you'll be prompted for:

    - **Project directory**
    - **Codemod type:**
      - <Tooltip tip="Best for simple code transformations. Uses the JavaScript ast-grep engine.">JavaScript ast-grep (jssg) codemod</Tooltip>
      - <Tooltip tip="Best for orchestrating large-scale migration campaigns. Combines shell commands, YAML ast-grep rules, and JS codemods into a single workflow.">Multi-step workflow (shell command, YAML & jssg)</Tooltip>
    - **Target language**
    - **Project name**
    - **Description**
    - **Author**
    - **License type**
    - **If your codemod is private**

    This creates a new folder with the required files and structure.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Explore the generated project">
    An example codemod package:

    ```plaintext
    example-codemod/
    ├── .gitignore
    ├── README.md
    ├── codemod.yaml        # Codemod package manifest and metadata
    ├── workflow.yaml       # Workflow definition for running the codemod
    ├── scripts/            # JS/TS codemods and shell scripts
    │   └── codemod.ts      # JS ast-grep codemod entry point
    └── rules/              # YAML ast-grep rule definitions
        └── config.yml
    ```

    <Info>
      You can combine different codemod types in a single package. The <code>scripts/</code> and <code>rules/</code> folders are conventional, not required—use any paths you prefer as long as you reference them correctly from <code>workflow.yaml</code>.
    </Info>

    Check out the [codemod package structure](/cli/packages/package-structure) for more details.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Understand an example workflow">
    The generated <code>workflow.yaml</code> will differ depending on the codemod type you select:

    ```yaml Combined (jssg + yaml + shell + ai)
    version: "1"
    nodes:
      - id: run-all
        name: Combined Example
        type: automatic
        steps:
          # 1) JS ast-grep (jssg)
          - name: "JS ast-grep codemod"
            js-ast-grep:
              js_file: "scripts/codemod.ts"
              base_path: "."
              language: "typescript"
              include:
                - "**/*.ts"
                - "**/*.tsx"

          # 2) YAML ast-grep
          - name: "Apply YAML ast-grep rules"
            ast-grep:
              config_file: "rules/config.yml"
              base_path: "./src"
              include:
                - "**/*.ts"
              exclude:
                - "**/*.test.ts"

          # 3) AI step
          - name: "AI review"
            ai:
              prompt: |
                Summarize risky changes and suggest tests.
          
          # 4) Shell command
          - name: "Format code"
            run: npx prettier --write "**/*.{ts,tsx,js,jsx}"

    ```

  </Step>

  <Step title="Validate & run your codemod package">
    ```bash
    npx codemod workflow validate -w workflow.yaml
    npx codemod workflow run -w workflow.yaml
    ```

    This will check your workflow for errors and then run it locally.

    <Info>
      The <code>workflow validate</code> command checks syntax and schema compliance, but not logical correctness. Always test with real data to ensure expected behavior.
